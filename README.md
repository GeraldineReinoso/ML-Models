# ML Models

This notebook explores a bank customer dataset to predict the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and machine learning modeling. Key steps involve encoding categorical features, normalizing data, splitting into train and test sets, and implementing KNN, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression models. Model performance is assessed through accuracy metrics, providing insights into effective predictive techniques within the banking sector.
